    <p>So what exactly is version control? It's quite simple really. Version control is what developers use to track changes in their code. You may have seen programs listed as 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and wondered what that means. It simply means what version of the code is being used! Now those changes are on a larger scale, consisting of many small changes, but version control can be used down to a single line of code being changed. This enables the developer to quickly look back through the code and see what was done, when, and even why if good messages are used with each 'save point'. This is where branches become important. You can think of branches very much like the branches on a tree. The main code, usually the working code that is being actively used, is commonly called the master branch, but can really be considered the trunk of our code tree. Each new branch is a copy of the code it is being pulled off of, which is often the master branch, but can also be a branch itself. When changes are made to this code, it doesn't affect the master branch until it is completed and implemented.</p>

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    I didn't use it here, but I'm particularly fond of aside. Today I learned that it could be used for more than just sidebars! So that was exciting. Main is awesome, and it wasn't appropriate for the selection I used, but Header and Footer are going to be in like... everything. They're perfect for ... it's really explains itself.

  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    The elements get placed on the page in the order they are typed in. CSS will change that, but it's good to keep in mind because screen readers can get a bit lost in navigation and such.

  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
    html->tab is the most magical beautiful thing ever. Except kittens with puppies. But in coding. I'm tired. On a more serious note, I learned about how to create snippets, and where to look at them. I'll definitely be looking for ways to keep my workflow neat using snippets and making new ones where my research tells me there are none.
