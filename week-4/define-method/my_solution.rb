# Your Solution Below

def do_something (one, two, three)
end

#How do you define a local variable?
# => A local variable is one that is used to represent a value within that code file.
# => This can be a specific amount or other output, or it can require user input.
#What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
# => A local variable is an object. A method does stuff.
#How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
# => To run a ruby command from the command line, navigate to the .rb file and type "ruby file_name_here.rb"
#How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
# => running an RSpec file is the same as running Ruby, except you type "rspec file_name_here.rb"
#What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
# => I'm having some slight trouble with return/puts ect. Most of it is easy though, once I get that out of the way.
