#What does puts do?
puts simply writes what follows it to the console.
#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number, while a float is a number including decimal points.
#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Dividing by floats gives you a accurate answer for solutions that fall between integers. Integer division rounds down the number to a whole number, thereby giving you the last whole number that gives you what you need. This can be important in things like finding out how many times you can drive to the store on a single tank of gas. Part of a trip wouldn't be helpful, so the float would be superfluous.

puts 'The number of hours in a year is '
puts 24*365

puts 'The number of minutes in a decade is '
puts (((60*24)*365)*10)
