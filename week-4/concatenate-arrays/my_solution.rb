# Concatenate Two Arrays

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below

# def array_concat(array_1, array_2)
#   array = [array_1, array_2]
#   array.flatten!
# end
#probably higher level than supposed, but I remember this from WGR and can't seem to back down from this

def array_concat (array_1, array_2)
  (array_1).concat(array_2)
end
