CREDIT CARD VALIDATION FORMULA FROM 6.7 (references to ruby)
-For this challenge, you will need to break down the algorithm into the following steps. You will probably want to break these down into individual methods that are called when you run the #check_card method.
-Starting with the second to last digit, double every other digit until you reach the first digit.
-Sum all the untouched digits and the doubled digits (doubled digits need to be broken apart, 10 becomes 1 + 0).
-If the total is a multiple of ten, you have received a valid credit card number!
-Your class will need to return true or false when you call the #check_card method. Your class needs to be initialized with a credit card number that is exactly 16 digits -- otherwise you should receive an ArgumentError.
