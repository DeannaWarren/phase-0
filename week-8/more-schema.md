<p>This is a one to one schema of Wheel of Time characters and their respective titles. One character can have many titles, but any titles are only applicable to them, and are best stored as one long title. Many characters have no title, and some have a title at the beginning or end, and gain or lose them. 14 books is an awful lot to maintain a title after all. Therefore one character has one set of titles each for the beginning and end of the series. </p>
