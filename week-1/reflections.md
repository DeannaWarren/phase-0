#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is the command line, more specifically the program you use the command line in. Bash is the command line terminal basis for Mac.

The most challenging thing for me was disabusing myself of the need for GUI. I'd never used the command line before except for setting up the computer. I didn't like it before, but I do now. That's probably in part because I've never had a Mac, and I just cannot seem to get the hang of navigating. But I can do it in the terminal!

I was able to successfully use the commands, but I had trouble using MV to rename a file. I'll revisit that. I think that's less of a use issue and more of a comprehension issue. The most important commands to know for me: Definitely pwd and ls. Anything regarding making and navigating directories.

PWD: Prints wording working directory. Prints the file path to where you are.

LS: Prints the folders and files contained in the working directory.

MV: Used to move files and I believe to rename them.

CD: Change directory, go further into a directory tree.

.. / Used along with CD to move up the directory tree or out of the tree

Touch: Make new empty files.

MKDir: Make a new directory within the one you are currently on.

Less: I used to open text or other kind of file and show the contents one screen at a time.

RmDir: Remove empty directories on your computer

Rm: Remove files.

Help: Will print list of commands that is not in the manuals.



#1.4 Forking and Cloning reflection

I think the easiest way to create a new repo would be to create it in GitHub, which is pretty self explanatory and then clone it to your computer. This is done by opening the repo on GitHub and finding the clone URL on the right side of the page. You can copy the URL manually or click the button that automatically copies it to your clipboard. Opening the terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like to place the repository locally on your computer, and type "git clone (PASTE COPIED URL HERE)". When you hit enter, the process will download the files to your computer.

You can fork a repo if you want to work on your own copy of another project, such as an open source project. You do this by visiting the page where the repo you would like to fork is, then click Fork button towards the top right of the page. You may be prompted as to which profile you would like to fork to if you have multiple profiles to your account. Once it it forked, a copy of it will be listed as your repository, which you can clone as above.

The biggest issue I've had actually isn't actively setting up git/Github. It's actually that I've been struggling with deleting the repository? So far I haven't had any luck with doing it in the command line, but I can do it in the GUI and I'm going to work more on it. I've had fair luck with the command line but it's not completely intuitive to me. I have learned that there are some small gaps in my knowledge of the command line that I need to do more research on. I'm keeping a file in my programming directory of questions for further research when questions like this come up.
