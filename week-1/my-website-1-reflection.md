Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
>Go on Github. Click the plus sign at the top and hit New Repository. Name it, pick a license, and click "Create Repository". When the repository comes up, look for "HTTPS clone URL" below settings in the right sidebar. Going into your command line terminal, make sure you are in the folder you would like to place the repository into. Type "git clone " and then paste the URL before hitting enter. The process should complete quickly and you will have created and cloned your repository!!

Describe what open source means.
>Open source basically means some form of other people can use this for free and/or change it for their own purposes. There may or may not be limits based on what type of license is used.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
>I think that Open Source is very important. I feel that there are some projects that by design can't be Open Source, like competitive games and the like, but for a great many things it's important to share knowledge and skills, and by giving people the option to use and/or change your project, it can grow beyond your personal skillset.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
>Licenses tell the user what kind of Open Source you are employing, or that you are not employing Open Source at all. This makes them aware of their rights regarding the use of your product. Therefore they are very important.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
>I got much better at ... well, the entire process ha. This was my moment when I really got how to do it, even though I had the technical knowledge before. I did have a small struggle in that I didn't properly save my HTML file, so when I had my website all set up, the HTML was empty and the page was blank! But that just gave me more practice with the process of making changes, so I don't regret the hiccup.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
>Didn't need any additional resources, although I did a few quick google searches to double check my git commands when I was unsure rather than go through my notes. I wanted to make sure I was able to find the info I already sort of know as practice for finding things I don't know in the future.
